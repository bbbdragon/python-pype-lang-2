# python-pype-lang-2

Welcome to pype version 2!  This is largely a re-do of the old python-pype-lang, with one major change - I stripped out the interpreter and am now using only the compiler.  Documenation is soon to come, but please run some examples in the `pype2/examples` directory to get a feel for how to use this.
